#  CodeCuisine Menu Display System Challenge

## Description:
 
In this challenge, I havel built a simple menu display system for a fictional UberEats restaurant called "CodeCuisine." The goal was to display different categories of food items and allow users to add items to their order with a click. This challenge will helped me to understand JavaScript concepts, including functions like `displayMenuItems(menu)`, `addToOrder(itemName)`, and `initMenuSystem(menu)`.
